# ðŸ–¥ Naming Malware

The malware has .malz suffix to the end of any malware I download, copy across to the FlareVM

When the file is zipped, I'll name the malware the actual malware name with the .exe for example with the zip, 7z extension so that I'll know what the zipped malware is.

Once extracting the malware, we need to arm the malware by removing the .malz suffix.

Before running malware double check that the environment is setup, that you can ping each VMachine to and from, and that when you enter a web address you get the default inetsim page.
