# ðŸ’» Setup Workstation Virtual Network

Workstation - Edit Menu - Virtual Network Editor

You'll need to click the change settings button to get Administrator access before changes can be made.

Create a new VMnet adapter. I used VMnet2

HuskyHaks video suggest using 10.0.0.1, Workstation wouldn't allow me to use this address with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, so I chose 192.168.1.0, the address doesn't matter, it's the VMnet name that's important.

With REMnux and FlareVM both shutdown, their Virtual network adapter must now be changed to the VMnet that you chose.

Chose a VMachine, and select Edit, in the Hardware tab, select Network Adapter, select custom, and from the drop down menu pick your new network adapter, and repeat this for the other VMachine.

Now run both VMachines. In Flare run cmder, (newly install super terminal) type ifconfig, and check it's assigned address is within range of VMnet2. For REMnux, use ip a command.

In both machines ping google.com, and ping 8.8.8.8, all 4 commands should fail.

Now ping each other, each command should succeed.
