# âš™ FlareVM Setup

In search bar enter view network connections, open Ethernet adapter, select properties, select internet protocol 4, select properties, and change dns server to the remnux address (my one is 192.168.1.129). Select OK.

I had to restart the VMachine FlareVM, for this to take effect.

Now typing any URL should return the default inetsim web page.
