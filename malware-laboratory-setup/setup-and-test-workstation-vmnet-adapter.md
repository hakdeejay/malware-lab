# ðŸ’» Setup and Test Workstation VMnet adapter

Workstation - Edit Menu - Virtual Network Editor

You'll need to click the change settings button to get Administrator access before changes can be made.

Create a new VMnet adapter. I used VMnet2.

HuskyHaks video suggest using 10.0.0.0;

Click check box - Host only (connect VM's internally in a private network).

Click DHCP settings and enter following ip address range.

**With REMnux and FlareVM both shutdown**, their Virtual network adapter must now be changed to the VMnet that you just setup.

Chose a VMachine, and select Edit, in the Hardware tab, select Network Adapter, select custom, and from the drop down menu pick your new virtual VMNet adapter, and repeat this for the other VMachine.

Now run both VMachines.&#x20;

In Flare run cmder, (newly install super terminal) type ifconfig, and check it's assigned address is within range of VMnet2. For REMnux, use ip a command.

In both machines ping google.com, and ping 8.8.8.8, all 4 commands should fail.

Now ping each VMachine, each command should succeed.
