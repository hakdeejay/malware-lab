# ðŸ”¥ Installing FlareVM

Flare repository is now at the above address.

It takes a long time to install, it will restart your VMWin 10 many, many times and there are errors. The fixes I found to correct them.

Rename the Win 10 Ent. to include FlareVM, it's best to seperate it from other Win10 VM's.
