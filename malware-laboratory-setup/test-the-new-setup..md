# ðŸ–¥ Test the new setup.

Open a browser, and type a fake URL in the address bar. If everything is setup correctly the default web page supplied by inetsim from REMnux should be returned. This gives a 200 OK code as well.

This should work for both http and https

If you also try to download a fictitious file, inetsim will return a fake download, again fooling the malware into responding successful completion.

Try it, use a random fake web address with /fake.exe and watch fake.exe download.
