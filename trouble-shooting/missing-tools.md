# Missing Tools

A simple solution is to download on host and drag across to Flare VMachine.

But if this is not possible then the other solution is to download and install on Flare itself.

You need to change back to the NAT.

Menu - Edit - change settings for admin privileges.

Click VMnet2 (the one you chose to use).

Click NAT in VMnet Information

Click OK

Type Ethernet settings in search

Select IP4 and click properties,

Check options for both ip and DNS are set to automatic

Click OK, and restart

You must remember to revert back these settings once the missing tool is installed and downloaded.

Menu - Edit - change settings for admin privileges.

Click VMnet2 (or which ever you chose to use) Information.

Click Host Only in VMnet Information

Click OK

Type Ethernet settings in search

Select IP4 and click properties,

Check options for both and DNS to 10.0.0.2 (or your address you chose)

Click OK, and restart\
