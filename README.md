# Malware laboratory setup

I own VMWare workstation 16 and so wanted to use this for my labs.

This writeup will aid in setting up Workstation 16, the problems I faced and solutions I found.

I also show you how to setup REMnux for dark mode, which is somewhat troublesome.

These are my own notes I made while running through the course, so they'll be updated as needed.
