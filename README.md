# Malware Laboratory Setup

I own VMWare workstation 16 and so wanted to use that software for my lab.

This is my write up for setting up that Workstation, the problems I faced and solutions I found.

I also show you how to setup REMnux for dark mode, which is somewhat troublesome.

These are my own notes I made while running through the course, so I will be updating them
